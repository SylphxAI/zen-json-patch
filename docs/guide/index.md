# Getting Started

Welcome to zen-json-patch! This guide will help you get started with generating JSON Patch operations (RFC 6902) by comparing JSON objects.

## What is JSON Patch?

JSON Patch is a format for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JSON document. It's defined in [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) and is useful for:

- Describing changes between two JSON documents
- Minimizing data transfer over networks
- Implementing undo/redo functionality
- Building version control systems for JSON data

## What is zen-json-patch?

zen-json-patch is a high-performance TypeScript library for **generating** JSON Patch operations by comparing two JSON objects. It's:

- **Fast** - Optimized diff algorithm with smart object handling
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with strict types
- **Standard** - RFC 6902 compliant operations
- **Lightweight** - Zero runtime dependencies
- **Simple** - Single function API

## Installation

Choose your preferred package manager:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install zen-json-patch
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add zen-json-patch
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add zen-json-patch
```

```bash [bun]
bun add zen-json-patch
```

:::

## Basic Usage

Import the `diff` function and compare two objects:

```typescript
import { diff } from 'zen-json-patch';

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: "hello", c: true };
const obj2 = { a: 2, b: "hello", d: false };

const operations = diff(obj1, obj2);

console.log(operations);
// [
//   { op: 'replace', path: '/a', value: 2 },
//   { op: 'remove', path: '/c' },
//   { op: 'add', path: '/d', value: false }
// ]
```

That's it! The `diff` function returns an array of JSON Patch operations that describe how to transform `obj1` into `obj2`.

## Operation Types

zen-json-patch generates three types of operations:

### Add

Adds a new property or array element:

```typescript
{ op: 'add', path: '/newProperty', value: 'newValue' }
```

### Remove

Removes an existing property or array element:

```typescript
{ op: 'remove', path: '/oldProperty' }
```

### Replace

Replaces the value of an existing property or array element:

```typescript
{ op: 'replace', path: '/existingProperty', value: 'newValue' }
```

::: info
The `move` and `copy` operations defined in RFC 6902 are not yet generated by zen-json-patch, but may be added as optimizations in future versions.

## TypeScript Support

zen-json-patch is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions:

```typescript
import { diff, Operation, AddOperation, RemoveOperation, ReplaceOperation } from 'zen-json-patch';

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string;
}

const before: User = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const after: User = { name: "Alice", age: 31, email: "alice@example.com" };

const operations: Operation[] = diff(before, after);

operations.forEach((op) => {
  switch (op.op) {
    case 'add':
      console.log(`Added ${op.path} = ${op.value}`);
      break;
    case 'remove':
      console.log(`Removed ${op.path}`);
      break;
    case 'replace':
      console.log(`Changed ${op.path} to ${op.value}`);
      break;
  }
});
```
